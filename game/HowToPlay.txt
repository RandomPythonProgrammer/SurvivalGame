Story:

there is no official story but if you really need some context or story here is one:

You are a zoo manager, and you need to keep track of the animals during the night. All of
the animals have been infected with rabies so you dont want them to bite you. You have
electrical fences that use electricity to deter animals from coming into your office.
There is a bat that is stationed behind you that you must distract with food so they dont
attack you. The rat chews on your wires and drains your power, so you have to shock it
to temporarily deter it
